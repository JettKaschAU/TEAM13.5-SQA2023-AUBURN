  Activities:  Created and managed Github repository. Created git hook in order to report security vulnerabilities and export vulenerabilities to a .csv file.
 
  Lessons Learned: Throughout the project I have become much more familiar with the functionality of both git and GitHub. I especially enjoyed working with git hooks as I like the idea of adding customization to the flow of repository management. In general, I have become much more familiar with simple but effective automation techniques that can be used in software development.

  Activities: Implememted software forensics through logging in main.py and parser.py. Logs will output to "forensics_log.txt".

  Lessons Learned: Through this project, I've honed my skills in implementing secure software practices, with a specific focus on effective logging. Understanding the significance of logging for error tracking and system behavior has been a key takeaway.
