  Activities:  Created and managed Github repository. Created git hook in order to report security vulnerabilities and export vulenerabilities to a .csv file.
 
  Lessons Learned: Throughout the project I have become much more familiar with the functionality of both git and GitHub. I especially enjoyed working with git hooks as I like the idea of adding customization to the flow of repository management. In general, I have become much more familiar with simple but effective automation techniques that can be used in software development.
